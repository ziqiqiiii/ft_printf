# ft_printf
This is the first circle of 42 core programme project. Basically a project that mimic the function printf() in c.
In this project, I am trying to code a ft_printf function that can deal with %c %d %s %i %p %u %x %X.
%c is used to printf character.
%s is used to printf string.
%d is for decimal (base 10).
%i is integer (base 10).
%u is unsigned integer (base 10).
%x is hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase.
%X is hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase.
%p is pointer.
